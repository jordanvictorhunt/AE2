This project was aimed around responsive design. I first had to complete research around responsive design. Then I had to create six responsive web pages. 

To create the pages I had to use sites such as codepen to gather code that I could implement into my site that would make images and text responsive.  Gathering information about key responsive technologies such as CSS grids and FlexBox's it's been an manageable to change standard pages into responsive  pages. 

On each page I've included a PNG of my logo. The reason that I've used a PNG is that it's a lossless file format designed as a more open alternative to graphic interchange format. When resized it doesn't loose picture quality. 

I've added CSS to all aspects of my design to ensure everything is responsive.

I've changed my Navigation bar from the first design because I thought it could improve it. Now when the screen size is decreased it'll turn into a hamburger menu rather than the links piling ontop of eachother.

Adding responsive technology to the form on my Contact page ensures that if the screen size is less than 600px wide it'll make the two columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other. 

Adding Rollover images to my Education and Qualifcations page was something that I thought would give it flare.
