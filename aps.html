  <h1>Academic Skills</h1>
    
  <p>I have fantastic organisational skills. I can create my own and stick to set deadlines. I can set myself goals and reach them. My time management skills are great because I use tools such as diaries and planners to help keep myself on track. I also have team and project management skills. <br><br>
      
Prioritization is very important to me and I always make sure that nothing gets in the way of completing an important task. <br><br>
      
I'm not easily distracted and concentrate on whatever it is that I'm doing. I turn off access to anything that can distract me from my work so that I have no distractions to slow my work progress. <br><br>
      
I'm very driven and motivated to do the best that I possibly can. I have goals in life that I want to reach and I know that hard work and determination will help me reach those goals. 
 </p>
  
    <h1>Personal Skills</h1>
    
  <p>I'm a peoples person so I love to work as part of a team. I can perform highly as the leader of a group or as just a member of one. <br><br>
      
I'm Dependable and I do my best to prove to people that I am. When working in a team it's important to me that other members of the group know that they can count on me to complete my given tasks. <br><br>
      
Critical thinking is another personal skill that I possess.  I'm able to solve problems on my own using creative thinking and thoughtful analysis.<br><br>
      
I care about the people that I work with. I take their feelings into consideration and I ensure that everyone who works with me is at ease and feels comfortable.  </p>
