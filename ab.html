  <h1>About Me</h1>
    
  <p>My name is Jordan Hunt and I am 19 years old. I live in Southampton and study Web design and Development at Southampton Solent University.</p>
    
  <p>Once I graduate I would love to move into the field and work as a Web Developer.  I find the subject very thought-provoking and feel as though the work would be interesting and would keep me motivated to perform at my highest level.</p>
    
  <p>I've studies I.T related subjects in GCSE, A-level and at university level. I also spend a lot of my own time researching these subject so I have a wide range of knowledge and experience. </p>
    
  <p>I'm a people person so I love to work in groups but I also have the skill to work alone. I can be trusted to complete work by set deadlines and to the standard expected.</p>
