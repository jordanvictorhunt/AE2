    <td>Code Acadamy</td>
    <td>I was asked by the Head Teacher of my local Primary School to run an after school Coding Club to teach students in year 6 the basics of coding, I happily obliged.  The club is fully subscribed and has not only helped the children, but has broadened my own understanding of coding.  I believe that it has been a fantastic opportunity for both the children and myself</td>
